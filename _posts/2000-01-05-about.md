### We <3 Carpooling

- UofACarpool makes it easy to find carpool partners who are coming from the same area as you, and who also belong to the University community.

- Just fill out a simple profile questionnaire to quickly and securely find carpool partners. You will be shown potential matches based on close origin and destination points, similar work/study schedules and compatible preferences.

- This ride-matching service is free, and a spreadsheet is returned when you search for carpool partners, but no personal information is released to potential matches apart from name, email, phone number (if desired), and distance.

- This carpool website is ideal for daily commutes to and from the University of Alberta.
